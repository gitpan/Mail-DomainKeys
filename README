THIS MODULE IS OFFICIALLY UNSUPPORTED.

Please move on to DKIM like a responsible Internet user.  I have.

I will leave this module here on CPAN for a while, just in case someone
has grown to depend on it.  It is apparent that DK will not be the way
of the future. Thus, it is time to put this module to ground before it
causes any further harm.

Thanks for your support,
Anthony

PS: Don't get a CPAN email address if you can avoid it. Muchos spam.

Yuck, I hate writing documentation.  You get what you pay for, though.  I
intend to do a full documentation set starting with version 0.80.

Starting with version 0.79, the canonifiers are much more conformant to the
DomainKeys draft. Mail::DomainKeys now passes the DomainKeys canonifier
torture tests available here:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=107680&package_id=148819

Be aware that DomainKeys is going out of fashion; it appears that DKIM may
be its successor. It's still up in the air, though, as far as I can tell.

Installation is ala mode:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Please send bug reports to <anthonyu@cpan.org>.  Sign them with DomainKeys
if possible. :)  Please include the version numbers of the following
modules:

Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA
Mail::Address
MIME::Base64
Net::DNS
Text::Wrap

Thanks!

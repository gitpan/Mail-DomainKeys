Yuck, I hate writing documentation.  You get what you pay for, though.  I
intend to do a full documentation set once the interfaces are finalized.

If you are downloading this from CPAN, you probably want the qpsmtpd plugin,
too. http://killa.net/infosec/domainkeys/

Installation is ala mode:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Please send bug reports to <anthonyu@cpan.org>.  Sign them with DomainKeys
if possible. :)  Please include the version numbers of the following
modules:

Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA
Mail::Address
MIME::Base64
Net::DNS

Thanks!

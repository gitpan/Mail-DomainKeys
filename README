Yuck, I hate writing documentation.  You get what you pay for, though.  I
intend to do a full documentation set starting with version 0.80.

Starting with version 0.79, the canonifiers are much more conformant to the
DomainKeys draft. Mail::DomainKeys now passes the DomainKeys canonifier
torture tests available here:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=107680&package_id=148819

Be aware that DomainKeys is going out of fashion; it appears that DKIM may
be its successor. It's still up in the air, though, as far as I can tell.

Installation is ala mode:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Please send bug reports to <anthonyu@cpan.org>.  Sign them with DomainKeys
if possible. :)  Please include the version numbers of the following
modules:

Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA
Mail::Address
MIME::Base64
Net::DNS
Text::Wrap

Thanks!
